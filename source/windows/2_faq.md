::: warning
Much of the information in this e-book is deprecated or no longer applicable.

Nowadays I recommend using MongoDB Atlas for local development, as it's much easier than installing MongoDB in your computer.

Our Complete Python Course has also been updated so that the information in this e-book is no longer necessary.

### Q: **Why do I not need to run mongod, as shown in the course videos?**  
 A: Windows runs MongoDB as a service.  A service is a program that executed the moment a user logs into Windows and never quits.  All operating systems do this, and Windows does this using services.

### Q: **Can I manually control this?**
 A: Yes.  Click on the Windows start button, and search for **Services**.  Then scroll down to mongod, and right-click on it, and select properties.  There you can stop the service and change the start up to manual. 

::: danger
Be very careful you do not shut off any other Services. If you are unsure about what you are doing, don't change anything. MongoDB doesn't use a lot of resources, so it will not hurt your system just to leave it running.
